        <p>Kannaur Lokesh Rahul, commonly known as KL Rahul, is a talented Indian cricketer born on April 18, 1992, in
            Bangalore. He is known for his stylish stroke play and solid technique. Over the years, Rahul has
            represented India
            in all three formats — Tests, ODIs, and T20s — and has adapted well to each role. Apart from being a
            top-order
            batsman, he also serves as a reliable wicket-keeper when needed. He has played key innings in important
            matches and
            often opens the batting or plays in the middle order. As of now, Rahul remains an important part of India's
            cricket
            setup and continues to perform in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as well.</p>
